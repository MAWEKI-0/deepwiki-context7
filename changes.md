2. Significant Architectural Inconsistency in Dependency Management
You've established a clean dependency injection pattern in src/main.py using FastAPI's Depends. However, this discipline is abandoned in src/query_engine.py.
code
Python
# src/query_engine.py

# ...
async def synthesize_answer(...):
    # ...
    retriever = SupabaseHybridRetriever(
        supabase_client=get_settings().supabase_client, # <--- HARD-CODED DEPENDENCY
        embedding_model=embedding_model,
        k=k,
        filter_criteria=filter_criteria,
    )
    # ...
In synthesize_answer, you fetch the Supabase client by directly calling get_settings().supabase_client. This breaks the dependency injection pattern, makes the function harder to test in isolation (you can't easily inject a mock client), and is inconsistent with how you get gemini_pro and embedding_model which are passed in correctly. This should be refactored to take supabase: Client as an argument, just like the FastAPI endpoint that calls it.
3. The Testing Strategy is Woefully Inadequate
This is the single biggest weakness of the project.
tests/test_main.py: A single /health check is effectively useless. It provides a false sense of security. There are zero tests for your core business logic: the /ingest-ad and /query-ads endpoints.
test_runner.py: This is not a test suite; it is a smoke test or an end-to-end integration script. Its reliance on asyncio.sleep(15) is a massive red flag. Time-based waits create flaky, unreliable tests that will fail intermittently in a real CI/CD environment.
Critique: For a system this complex, you need a multi-layered testing strategy:
Unit Tests: Your utility functions and individual pipeline steps in enrichment_pipeline.py and query_engine.py should be unit-tested. Use pytest-mock to mock LLM calls and database interactions. Can perform_strategic_analysis correctly parse a mocked LLM response? What happens if the LLM returns malformed JSON?
Integration Tests: Test the FastAPI endpoints by mocking the external services. When you call /ingest-ad, does it correctly insert data into a test database and dispatch a Celery task (mocked)?
Contract Tests: Your Pydantic models are your contracts. Ensure they are robust. What happens if an LLM leaves out confidence_score? Your application will crash. The models should be more defensive.
Part II: Code-Level Critiques
1. Brittle and Prone to Failure: Unsafe JSON Parsing
Your enrichment pipeline assumes the LLM will always return perfect JSON. This is a naive assumption that will break in production.
code
Python
# src/enrichment_pipeline.py

def perform_visual_analysis(...) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ...
    response = chain.invoke({"ad_creative_url": ad_creative_url})
    return response.json() # <--- WHAT IF THIS ISN'T VALID JSON?
The call to .json() will raise a JSONDecodeError if the LLM output is malformed (e.g., includes conversational text like "Here is the JSON you requested..."). You are already using PydanticOutputParser for StrategicAnalysis; you should create a similar Pydantic model and parser for VisualAnalysis to enforce the structure and handle parsing errors gracefully.
2. Inefficient Client Instantiation in Celery Tasks
In src/tasks.py, you are re-instantiating all clients (supabase, gemini_flash, etc.) on every single task execution.
code
Python
# src/tasks.py
def enrichment_task(self, ad_data_dict: dict):
    # ...
    supabase = get_supabase_client() # <-- Called every time
    gemini_flash = get_gemini_flash() # <-- Called every time
    gemini_pro = get_gemini_pro()     # <-- Called every time
    # ...
While this works, it's inefficient. For services with connection pooling or complex setup, this adds unnecessary overhead. A better pattern for Celery is to instantiate clients at the worker level, so they are created once per worker process and reused across tasks. This can be achieved using Celery signals like @worker_process_init.connect.
3. Overly Permissive Database Policies
Your RLS policy in supabase/migrations/20250824000000_create_ads_table.sql is too open for a system that may evolve.
code
SQL
CREATE POLICY "Allow read access for all users" ON public.ads
FOR SELECT USING (true);
This makes all enriched ad data, including potentially sensitive raw_data_snapshots, public to any authenticated user. While this might be acceptable now, it's better to start with a more secure default. The policy should likely be restricted to service_role only, forcing all access to go through your vetted API endpoints.
4. Inefficient Data Transfer to Celery
You are passing the entire ad_data_dict to the Celery task.
code
Python
# src/main.py
enrichment_task.delay(ad_data_dict=inserted_ad.model_dump())
The raw_data_snapshot could be large. The standard practice is to only pass the unique identifier (the id of the ad) to the task. The task's first step is then to fetch the required data from the database using that ID. This keeps the message broker (Redis) payload small and ensures the worker always operates on the most current data from the database.
